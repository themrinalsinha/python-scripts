# GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data.

## Why GraphQL?
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## How does it work?
GraphQL is sent using HTTP POST requests to a single endpoint. The body of the request is a JSON document that describes the query you want to make. The server's response is also a JSON document, and it contains the result of executing the query.

## Getting Started
To get started with GraphQL, we recommend you to read the [Getting Started](https://graphql.org/learn/) guide.
